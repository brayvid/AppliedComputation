# AppliedComputation

Run_BestLine.m: Enter X and Y data as vectors and run to generate the slope and y-intercept of the line of best fit for the data, with either the 1-norm, 2-norm or Inf-norm.

Run_FirstOrderSystems.m: Enter one or more functions of t and y representing the first derivatives and run to plot the solution.

Run_GetDiffEqn.m: Enter a partial differential equation and run to generate the corresponding difference equation.

Run_Linprog.m: An interface for the [linprog](https://www.mathworks.com/help/optim/ug/linprog.html "linprog at Mathworks.com") function, which performs linear optimization.

Run_NumericalInt.m: Perform Riemann summation to approximate definite integrals.

Run_Orthdiag.m: Enter a matrix M and run to find the matrix A such that A'MA = D where D is a diagonal matrix.

Run_PlotSurfM.m: Provide a matrix of values of a 2-variable function and run to plot the corresponding surface.

Run_QuadDiag.m: Enter a quadratic function in N variables and run to find the substitution x = Ay that eliminates the function's cross terms.

Run_QuadMin.m: Enter a quadratic function in N variables and run to find the extremal values of the function.

Run_Quadprog.m: An interface for the [quadprog](https://www.mathworks.com/help/optim/ug/quadprog.html "quadprog at Mathworks.com") function, which performs quadratic optimization.

Run_SecondOrderODE.m: Input a single second order differential equation and run to plot the solution. 

Run_SolveDiffPDE.m: Provide a difference equation and boundary conditions and run to solve for the interior points.

Run_SolveLaplace.m: Provide a domain and boundary conditions and run to solve Laplace's equation in the interior.
